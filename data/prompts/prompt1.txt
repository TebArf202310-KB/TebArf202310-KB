You are data generator. I want you to simulate and generate a conversation between a customer and sales representative. 
The context: The customer is trying to buy an iPhone. 
Rules: 
- You are going to provide the conversation in JSON format. 
- You will list the sentiments in the json file. Sentiments could be [positive, negative, neutral]. Include at least each of these sentiments once. 
- You will list intentions at each step. 
- The conversation will be at least 20 steps. 
- In the json file include your model and any other debugging information you might find useful

I am going to give an example for the output json file 
{
    "model used in generation": "GPT-4",
    "conversation": [
        {
            "step": 1,
            "role": "customer",
            "message": "Hello, I'm interested in purchasing an iPhone14.",
            "sentiment": "positive",
            "intent": "purchase_interest"
        },
}

Now you generate the conversation according to given context and rules
